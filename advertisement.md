### Why should you join IKEA?

Hej! My name is `*****` and I lead our engineering teams in Order Promise at IKEA. As we are building our new hub in

journey.

At IKEA we have a vision to help more of the many people to have an affordable and better everyday life at home, and
be more convenient where they are. At the same time, we aspire to become truly people and planet positive.

The challenge of transforming such an iconic global brand is breath taking – You can read about INGKA’s ‘10 jobs in 3 years’
here https://bit.ly/ikea-10jobs, 5 of them are underpinned by the amazing work we will do in Fulfilment, Logistics &
Inventory Management.

We strongly believe that diverse engineering teams can really grow in an environment where cross-functional, product
focussed teams are empowered to make decisions and solve problems as autonomous teams. We believe that true innovation comes from co-creation, taking educated risks and daring to fail in safe surroundings. https://bit.ly/IKEA-
